# TaskList 

An app to track your tasks in a way that suits you!

This app was my first ever introduction to SwiftUI and declarative programming as a whole. This entire app was built very early into my iOS career and it's something I look back on as a huge achievement as I was able to release it onto the App Store all on my own. It might just be something I look to re-do using newer technologies and give a revamp.
